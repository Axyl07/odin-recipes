I created a simple HTML page that links to two other HTML pages to showcase two recipes. Here are the elements I used:

- **Anchor tag**: To link to the other HTML pages
- **Image tag**: To link to images from the web
- **Unordered list**: For listing the ingredients
- **Ordered list**: For listing the steps
